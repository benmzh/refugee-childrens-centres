  <h1>About Us</h1>
  <div class="rcc-centrer">
    <img class="rcc-normal rcc-float-right" src="images/paintings.jpeg">
  </div>
  <p class="bold">Refugee Children’s Centres provide a reliable, positive and caring environment to shield against the adverse experiences of refugee children’s unsettled lives.</p>
  <p>The Centres are safe and inviting spaces that allow children the opportunity to escape from the harsh reality of life on a refugee camp, providing an oasis of colour and fun, and the chance to be a child again.</p>
  <p>We offer activities which are stimulating and educational with the main focus on play therapy and language acquisition. We offer a safe, supervised play space, creative activities, sport, music, fun and friendship for children of all ages. The gates are always open for children to come and go as they please. Babies come accompanied by their parents, giving them a few hours of relief from the cramped conditions of their shelters.</p>
  <p>The effects of trauma, stressful experiences and lack of appropriate stimulating experiences in the formative years can create gaps in a child’s development, causing lifelong negative impacts. Many of the children end up living in a camp for many months, making up a substantial part of their early lives. For some children, the time spent in a refugee camp is all that they know and will make up their earliest memories.</p>
  <p>We aim to add some happy memories and hope for the future.</p>
  <p class="bold">We believe childhood memories should be happy memories.</p>
  <h1>The Importance of Play</h1>
  <div class="rcc-centrer">
    <img class="rcc-normal rcc-float-left" src="images/dolls-house.jpeg">
  </div>
  <p class="bold">Everything we do is based on the principal that play is an essential part of childhood.</p>
  <p>Play enables the development of vital physiological,  social and emotional skills. It allows children to build self-confidence and to develop secure and trusting relationships with others; it is a means of freedom of self-expression, healing and happiness.</p>
  <p class="bold">We believe that every child should have access to a safe, happy, caring and stimulating place to play.</p>
  <p>A sense of wonder and challenge and a desire to explore and discover is the foundation for the desire to learn. Many children in refugee camps, for one reason or another, are not yet ready to access education in a formal institutional settings.  Play as a form of therapy helps remove the barriers to learning.</p>
  <p class="bold">The right to play is recognised by the United Nations as a fundamental right of every child. Refugee Children’s Centres provide a place that meets this most basic right.</p>
